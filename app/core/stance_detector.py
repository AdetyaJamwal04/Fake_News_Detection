Stance Detector Module with Optimizations

Uses zero-shot classification via HF Inference API to determine if evidence
supports, refutes, or discusses a claim.

Model: BART-MNLI (facebook/bart-large-mnli) running on HF's GPU servers.

Optimizations applied:
- Confidence calibration (Rank 13)
- Outcome modifier detection (v2.2 - fixes false positives)
- Stricter entailment hypothesis (v2.2)
